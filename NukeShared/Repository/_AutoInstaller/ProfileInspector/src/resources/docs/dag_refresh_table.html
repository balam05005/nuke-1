    <h1>Refresh Table</h1>
    <p>
        The main functionality of this button is to take a "snapshot" of the current state and save it into the table.
        (e.g when adding or deleting nodes, the table must be updated in order to reflect the changes).
    </p>
    <p>
        When the profiling listener is activated, by refreshing the table, you will also save the current timings state.
        <br>
        This means that you can stop the profiling listener in Nuke (so to save some cpu resources) but still be able to
        inspect the last timings values.
