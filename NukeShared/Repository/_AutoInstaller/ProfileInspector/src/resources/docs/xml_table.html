    <h1>XML Report Table</h1>
    <p>Table that displays the xml report file that Nuke generates. To open a file, use the <b>Open File</b> button on
        the toolbar.</p>
    <p>
        Each colum is a frame and on each row you will find the node name.
        Because some nodes could have long names, by hovering over a row, a tooltip
        will appear displaying the entire name.
    </p>

    <p>
        The table offers a the same search bar that is found on the Dag page, so the same
        features are available here; filter nodes using regex, filter by name, class etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Need To Knob</h2>
    <p>
        When loading a xml file, the plugin will try to verify that is a valid xml file before loading;
        that is, will try to check for syntax errors, and if is a valid Nuke profiling file. <br>
        When one or the other is not correct, the plugin will give an alert message with some indication on how to fix
        it (e.g. missing closing tag).
    </p>
    <p>
        Also keep in mind that, if you are trying to load an xml file that just be generated form Nuke,
        remember that, You must close the Nuke app in order for the file to be completed.
    </p>


    <h2>Un-dock Window</h2>

    <p>
        The entire table can be un-docked from the Nuke main window.
        <br>
        This can be done in two ways;
    <ul>
        <li>By double clicking on the window title bar</li>
        <li>By clicking on the un-dock icon.</li>
    </ul>

    You can dock back the window in the same way,
    double-clicking on the title bar or click on the close icon.
    </p>

    <h2>Order/Sort</h2>
    <p>
        The table allows to sort columns in ascending or descending order by clicking on a column header.
    </p>
