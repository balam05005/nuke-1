    <p>Change the timings format shown in the table.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Profiling type:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Change the profiling type.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>store</b> - store the values the user has selected on its knobs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>validate</b> - this is where the node tells Nuke about the output it produces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>request</b> - his is where the node works out what data it
                    will need from its inputs in order to produce its output
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>engine</b> - this is where the node does most of its work, and actually generates its output.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </dd>
        <dt><b>Call type: <b>(Not present in DAG Inspector)</b></b></dt>
        <dd>Change the call type inside the table.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>callCount</b> - tells you the number of times this part of the processing has been called.

                <li>
                    <b>timeTakenWall</b> - is the time taken as it would be measured by a clock on the wall,
                    i.e. the actual time a user would have to wait for the processing to complete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>timeTakenCPU</b> - On Linux, this is the time the CPU spent executing the processing code,
                    On Mac and Windows, the CPU time is not currently available.
                </li>
            </ul>
