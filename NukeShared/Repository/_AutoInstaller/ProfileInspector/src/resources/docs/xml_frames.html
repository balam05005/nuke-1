    <h1>Frames</h1>
    <p>Set the frame range for the table view.</p>
    <p>When the table is docked inside Nuke main window, is likely that there will not be
        much screen space to display tons of frames, so the default frame range is set to 10. <br>
        But because the window can be docked (and maximize on a different monitor for example),
        you could enable the custom frame range and set your own.
    </p>
    <p>
        The section also shows which node is the "heaviest" (for each call type) for the given frame range.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Max Call</b></dt>
        <dd>Node with the highest callCount from the given frame range</dd>

        <dt><b>Max CPU</b></dt>
        <dd>Node with the highest timeTakenCPU from the given frame range</dd>

        <dt><b>Max Wall</b></dt>
        <dd>Node with the highest timeTakenWall from the given frame range</dd>
    </dl>
